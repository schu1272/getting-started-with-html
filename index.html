    <title>Darrin's Notes</title>

<h1>The basics of the internet</h1>
<b>The internet is formed within the following parts</b>
<p>1. Requests are sent through a <b>HTTP</b> which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocal
  <br>2. These requests use the worlds largest computer network called the <b>Internet</b>
  <br>3. The request are received by <b>Servers</b> which are basically computers optimized to store files
  <br>4. <b>Browsers</b> receive and interprate the files and display the results to the users computer
</p>
<br><b>Webpage Foundation</b>
<p></p>Websites on their own are just <em>plaintext</em>. It does not take a lot to make a simple website
<br>However developers use <em>HTML</em> Or Hypertext Markup Language to add design to a website and format content on the website.
<br> HTML has the following parts:
<BR> - <b>Tags</b>
<br> - <b>Elements</b>
</BR>
<br> HTML elemnts are made up of tags. Elements being and end with a tag.
<br> A great way to learn HTML is at <a href="udacity.com">Udacity</a> However users should not limit themselves to what they can memorize,
<br> but should also use the internet and other sources to help them along their way.
</br>
<p>
  <B>Inline/Block Concept</B>
  <br> Inline and Block are two ways that appear similar but act in different way to format a webpage
  <eM>Blocks</eM> form an invisible box
  <br> around text that while <em>Inline</em> eliinates create a line break.
